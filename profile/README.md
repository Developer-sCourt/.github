## Hi there, from BlazeWebDev 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Welcome to Developer's Court. Here we're all about empowering and supporting young teens who want to be self-taught.
Contributions to projects are very much supported and should be done without hesitation, our projects are all made available in the repository section, and previews will be uploaded to netlify.
Fun Fact! This group is made up mostly of Dominion University Students.
